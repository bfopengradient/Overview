### Overview

Generally there is a small group of researchers whose work I draw from regularly. In many cases their work has been pivotal to the field of data science, NLP and ML. Some are infamous within the field of data science and some are less well known. I may not always cite them in my repos but I am grateful for their invaluable research. 


1. Yoshua Bengio 
2. Jason Brownlee 
3. François Chollet 
4. Jeff Dean 
5. Derek Green
5. Geoffrey Hinton
6. Matthew Honnibal and Ines Montani

In the repos that follow the data is both structured and unstructured. Most of the repos are focused on the financial services industry. Not all models are machine learning based and some are traditional with no self learning mechanism. Many of the repos are effectively test areas to assess how different models behave. The goal in production is to find the least complex model that best fits the data whether that be a machine learning algorithm or a traditional statistical model.
