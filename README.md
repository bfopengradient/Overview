## Overview

Generally there is a small group of researchers whose work I draw from regularly. In many cases their work has been pivotal to the field of ML and data science. Some are infamous within the field of data science and some are less well known. I may not always cite them in my repos but I am grateful for their invaluable research. 

Open Gradient in part is focused on data science, machine learning and natural language processing. The goal is to deliver the least complex models to the financial services domain to assist risk staff within that domain.
