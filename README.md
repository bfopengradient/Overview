### Overview

I have tried to cite all relevant researchers in the work contained in my repos. Generally there is a small group of researchers whose work I draw from regularly and who may or may not be mentioned in each repo. They include but are not limited to the following. 

If a new model is released and not open sourced by its creators the likelihood at the moment is researchers from one of Facebook, Google or Microsoft will release their model that is open sourced and it will dominate leaderboards. Thus the tendency is to focus on developments and researchers from a handful of universities and companies that open source their research and code.
