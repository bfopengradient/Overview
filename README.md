### Overview

There is a group of researchers within data science and machine learning whose work I draw from regularly. In many cases their work has been pivotal to the field of data science, natural language processing(NLP) and machine learning(ML). Some are less well known. I may not always cite them in my repos but I am grateful for their invaluable research. 

They are as follows:

1. Yoshua Bengio 
2. Jason Brownlee 
3. François Chollet 
4. Jeff Dean 
5. Assit. Prof. Derek Green, Computer science dept, University College Dublin.
5. Geoffrey Hinton
6. Matthew Honnibal and Ines Montani 
7. Andrej Karpathy 
8. Yann LeCun 
9. Tomas Mikolov 
10. Andrew Ng 
11. Srikantra Patra, GA Sydney
12. Radim Řehůřek 

All of the repos are test areas to assess how different algorithms behave on different datasets. There is a mixture of machine learning algorithms and traditional statistical models.
